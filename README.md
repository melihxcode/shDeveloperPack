# shDeveloperPack
for Shaiya Developers

Hello dear shaiya users,
I would like to introduce you to the application I have been working on for a long time: shDeveloperPack
I wanted to create an easy, practical and versatile application for developers and new developers. You will have the advantage of being able to instantly download the programs required for Shaiya Development with this application, without having to deal with infected sites or people selling free files for money. You will also be able to access information about Shaiya and Development, which I will develop and publish in v2.0.0.0 for new developers, directly from within the application. Server owners and developers will have more access and be able to easily manage your server with the Advanced Server Management Panel, which I will integrate into the application with the v3.0.0.0 update. If you have any problems, errors or suggestions, don't forget to contact me via FeedBack!
